- 👋 Hi, I’m Saad
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and Machine learning for PPG Signal processing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning tools for processing PPG signal 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Biomedical Circuits design 
- the "Applying KNN on the data" contains matlab code that perform data pre-processing using the data file "dataset_BCIcomp1" which contains 3D matrix data from 3 EEG sensors.
